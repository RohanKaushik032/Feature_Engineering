# What is Feature Engineering?
Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. It involves creating new features from existing ones to increase the predictive power of the learning algorithm.

# Techniques
## Imputation
Imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. Techniques include mean/mode imputation, using regression models, or more complex algorithms like KNN or MICE.

## Handling Outliers
Outliers can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. Techniques to handle outliers include trimming, capping, or using robust scaling methods.

## Binning
Binning is used to group a set of numerical values into a smaller number of bins to have a better understanding of the data distribution.

## Encoding Categorical Variables
Categorical variables can be transformed into numerical values through various encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding.

## Feature Scaling
Feature scaling methods, such as normalization and standardization, are used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data.

## Feature Selection
Feature selection techniques are used to select important features based on various statistical tests to reduce overfitting and improve model performance.

# Practical Examples
Here, we provide Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of feature engineering techniques on various datasets.
